I am not sure if a DESIGN.md is appropriate for this project but here is a brief description about how we implemented our project 
and why we made the design decisions we did. I think the major design decision we made was using Jupyter to present our 
project and anlysis. Jupyter Notebooks and very common among the online data science community and they are great because you can 
directly edit the code in the notebook and run it. 

The rest of the design desicions made in this project are clearly described in the CS50 Project.ipynb notebook. The code is well commented 
and we go through out thought process step by step.
