    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this project, we use a random forest classifier to predict who survived the sinking of the RMS Titanic. On our journey to achieving this goal, we go through the whole data science process from understanding the problem and getting the data to fine-tuning our models and visualizing our results. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Titanic dataset is perhaps the most widely analyzed dataset of all time. There are many incredible tutorials online exploring different approaches to analyzing this dataset. So in our own analysis, we draw on the experiences of many others who have already attempted this problem and shared their conclusions. We would especially like to thank [Manav Sehgal](https://www.kaggle.com/startupsci/titanic-data-science-solutions) and [Ahmed Besbes](https://ahmedbesbes.com/how-to-score-08134-in-titanic-kaggle-challenge.html) whom without their insight this project would not have become a reality.

    "## Understanding the problem\n",
    "Before we dive into the data analysis and algorithms, we first ask ourselves: is this even a problem that can be solved with machine learning? <br>\n",
    "Luckily for us, lots of books have been written about the sinking of the Titanic. So before we look at the data, we do some background reading and discover that some patterns might exist, most notably: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Women and children generally got first priority on the life boats \n",
    "    - This tells us that some people were more likely to survive than others\n",
    "2. The third class living quarters were the furthest away from the deck with the lifeboats\n",
    "    - This tells us that it was likely they got there after people had started crowding around the lifeboats\n",
    "    - Considering that the time of impact was at 11:40 PM, most of the passengers were probably in their cabins at the time of impact\n",
    "3. There was a lot of confusion during the sinking of the ship and people chose to stay on the Titanic for arbitrary reasons. \n",
    "    - There will definitely be anomalies in this dataset so we shouldn't expect our algorithm to have perfect accuracy.\n",
    "4. The timeline of the sinking was as follows:\n",
    "    - 2340: Impact at the starboard side\n",
    "    - 0005: Orders given to uncover the lifeboats and get everyone ready\n",
    "    - 0025: Lifeboat begin being loaded with women and children\n",
    "    - 0045: First lifeboat lowered with less than half of its max capacity\n",
    "    - 0205: The last lifeboat leaves the ship with over 1500 people left on the ship <br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - So it definitely took a while for the Titanic to sink and people to get on board the lifeboats\n",
    "    \n",
    "Aha, so it seems like a there are some patterns that can help us figure out who survived and who didn't. Our background reading also gave us tips about what we should look for. This looks like a great machine learning problem!"

    "We are going to use a random forest classifier to predict who survived and who didn't. A random forest are basically just a collection of decision trees. Decision trees ask a hierarchy of if/else questions until a decision is reached. Decision trees usually tend to overfit, meaning that they are very good at predicting things about the training data, but they fail to generalize to unseen data. Random forests address this problem by introducing some randomness into the problem. Each decision tree in a random forest is slightly different from the other, and each tree overfits in different ways because of the randomness associated with creating the trees. Then the outputs of all these individual trees are averaged to produce a result that is better than each tree's individual output and is less prone to overfitting. \n",

    "Here we are going to use the H2O implementation of the random forest classifier instead of the more commonly used scikit-learn implementation because it has been [shown](https://roamanalytics.com/2016/10/28/are-categorical-variables-getting-lost-in-your-random-forests/) that the way scikit-learn random forests deal with categorical variables introduces bias. In addition, there are no tutorials online analyzing the Titanic dataset using H2O and we wanted to contribute something new to the community of people who have attempted this problem. "
