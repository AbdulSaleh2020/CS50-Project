    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this project, we use random forests and (gradient boosting) machine learning algorithms to predict who survived the sinking of the RMS Titanic. On our journey to achieving this goal, we go through the whole data science process from understanding the problem and getting the data to fine-tuning our models and visualizing our results. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Titanic dataset is perhaps the most widely analyzed dataset of all time. There exists a wealth of incredible tutorials online exploring different approaches to analyzing this dataset. So in our own analysis, we draw on the experiences and learn from the mistakes of the huge community of amazing people who have already attempted this problem and shared their conclusions online. We would especially like to thank [Manav Sehgal](https://www.kaggle.com/startupsci/titanic-data-science-solutions), [Jeff Delaney](https://www.kaggle.com/jeffd23/scikit-learn-ml-from-start-to-finish), and [Ahmed Besbes](https://ahmedbesbes.com/how-to-score-08134-in-titanic-kaggle-challenge.html) whom without their insight this project would not have become a reality.
